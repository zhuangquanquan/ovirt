/**
 * This class is needed to decouple the searchbackend dependencies without introducing any DI frameworks or convulated
 * reference passing. It's a lightweight instance factory to solve situations where UI searchbackend needs different
 * instances than backend.
 * <p/>
 * Since searchbackend code is shared by UI and backend there is no way to reach other projects, that are specific to
 * each other, such as dal or uicommonweb.
 * <p/>
 * The first use case is searchbackend relying on Enums for value completion. If we want a completion object that
 * has values populated by code that is only accessible by both UI and backend we should better have the object
 * dependency managed outside, by the SyntaxChecker initiator.
